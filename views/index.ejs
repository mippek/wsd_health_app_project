<h1>Health reporting app</h1>
<p>
    This is an app for health reporting. You can send reports of your current health status for each day.
    There are two types of reports, morning reports and evening reports. Morning reports report your sleep 
    duration and quality whereas evening reports report your eating, exercising and studying for the day. Both 
    reports ask you for your mood for the day (morning or evening). 
    <br/><br/>
    Only users logged in can submit reports and view report summaries. To login press the Login button at the 
    top of the page. If you don't have an account, you can register by pressing on the Register button next to it.
    <br/><br/>
    After you've logged in you see button Reports and Summary at the top of the page. Reports can be made from 
    the button Reports. There you can choose whether you want to make an morning report or an evening report. 
    Pressing on the button of your choice leads you to the correct form. By default a new report is made for the 
    current date but the date can be changed to be able to make older reports as well. However, only one morning 
    report and one evening report is saved for each day. If you already have made the report for the day that you
    are making, the old report is removed and the new report is saved instead. 
    <br/><br/>
    The app shows a summary for each user by default from the past week and past month. This report only includes
    the users own data. This main page contains some data of all the users from today and yesterday. You can change 
    the week and month to see the summary of the week or month of your choice. The summary can be seen by pressing 
    the button Summary.
